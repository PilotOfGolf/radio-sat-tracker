            <p>This is a webpage that you can use to get information about satelites, with an emphasiss on the Amateur Radio (ham) aspect. This website can get data that is helpful for contesting, making general QSOs, or even just to learn more about satelites. </p>
            <p>This site uses the API  from <a href="https://www.n2yo.com">n2yo.com</a>. I like this site, but I am not a fan of the UI. I understand why it is kept simple, becuase simple is easy to use. Because of this shortcoming, I plan to make a site that looks better, and provides the same data (because I am using their API). </p>
            <h3 id="subheading">Questions? Need help? Encounter a Bug? Reach out!</h3>
            <p>If you happen to have an issue with the website or have a questoin, you can reach out by sending an email to [INSERT EMAIL HERE WHEN DOMAIN IS ESTABLISHED]</p>
