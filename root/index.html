        <h2>If you are having issues, it may be becuase your device has no GPS. Currently these devices are not supported, however the plan is for them to eventually become supported.
            However, altitude support for devices without an altimeter is going to be the priority, in terms of time, or potentially even API costs.
            If your device does not have a GPS, currently please do not try to access the main site, as I do not want to be making wasteful API calls. </h2>
